Well done to everyone who's called, emailed or visited the office of their MoC this first week of recess!

As many of us are scrambling to finish our taxes, what a perfect time to *call McCaul's office again to remind him that WE WANT TO SEE DONALD TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS!* There is simply no way we can know who he is indebted to or what policies his family personally profits from without the kind of transparency that every other president has submitted to. (sample script and contact info below)

We also hope that you will make it to the *TAX DAY MARCH* this Saturday at the Capitol. It will be a family-friendly event with speakers, live music, food trucks--and the weather will be lovely. If only all resistance could be this pleasant!

And lastly, if you haven't followed the Indivisible Page for the Texas State Legislature, you should! What Republicans get away with at the state level is borderline criminal, and empowers their national agenda, so "Like" the page to get updates about actions and events (they won't drown you in posts)

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Rep. McCaul. I am part of the overwhelming majority of Americans who wish to see the president's tax returns, and I am deeply troubled that Rep. McCaul has voted against the wishes of the people to protect Trump from scrutiny. With questions of foreign collusion and conflicts of interest, there has never been more need for transparency of the president's business dealings. Whether incriminating or no, I can see no ethical reason why McCaul would want to hide this information from the American people. Thank you.
