Call and tell our senators that we want an independent, non-partisan commission to investigate Russian interference in the November election.

**CALL our senators and TELL them that we want an independent, non-partisan commission, similar to the 9/11 commission, to investigate Russian interference in the November election.** After the House investigation stalled, many Americans placed their hope in the Senate probe. But they have not had any full-time staff until two days ago, and the pace has been maddeningly slow. This is a serious matter of national security, and the foot-dragging is unacceptable. 73% of Americans agree that they want an independent, non-partisan commission into the matter.
