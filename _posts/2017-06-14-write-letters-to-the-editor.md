Call to Action Wednesday June 14th, 2017

The House version of the AHCA is very destructive to the American healthcare system. According to the non-partisan CBO, 14 million Americans would lose health insurance next year. It would also dramatically increase premiums for older enrollees and people with pre-existing conditions. The Senate version is being negotiated in secret, with Republicans even briefly blocking press access to the Capitol on Tuesday. But with Ted Cruz driving the negotiation process, it is highly unlikely to be any improvement over the House version.

Write a letter to the editor in a local news outlet opposing both this terrible bill and the secretive process by which is it being negotiated! THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IF YOU LIVE IN A RURAL OR CONSERVATIVE AREA. Let's flood their inboxes!
