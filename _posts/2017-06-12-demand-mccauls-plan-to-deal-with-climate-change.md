Today, members of the Citizens Climate Lobby around the country will be calling their members of Congress to demand action on rising carbon emissions. To support this effort, we're planning a trip to McCaul's office to remind him all the ways that Trump's abandonment of the Paris Climate Accord hurts Texans now and for generations to come. Join us at McCaul's Austin office, or call the office to strengthen our voice!

Since saving the planet for its own sake doesn't seem to persuade most Republicans, we're going to focus on what they do care about: money and security. Opting out of renewable technology will cost Texans thousands of jobs in the years to come, while rising global temperatures will increase instability and war around the world, creating more of those refugees that Trump and McCaul are so afraid of. Meanwhile, reneging on global agreements will make it harder to win cooperation from other nations on national security matters. THIS IS ALL AROUND A BAD MOVE AND MCCAUL NEEDS TO KNOW WE KNOW!

## SAMPLE SCRIPT:
> Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Rep. McCaul. As chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, I want to know how Rep. McCaul plans to deal with the increase of instability and refugees that will result from unchecked climate change. Also, does he have any plan to make up for the lost revenues and jobs that leaving the Paris Climate Accord will cost the Texas energy sector? These are issues that will affect the security and prosperity of all Texans and we deserve to know whether he has taken them into account.
