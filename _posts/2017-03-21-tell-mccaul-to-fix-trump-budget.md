The president has released his "America First" budget and it’s grim. The proposed budget makes dramatic cuts to federal spending on the environment, international relations, and labor while adding $54 billion in defense spending. Additionally, it eliminates 19 federal agencies including the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the Corporation for National and Community Service.

**CALL Representative McCAUL and TELL YOUR STORY about why one of these affected programs is important to you personally. Staffers pay special attention to personal testimonials! Urge him to SUPPORT THE PROGRAMS YOU VALUE.**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Representative McCaul. I would like him to know that I support [THE EPA / THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS / THE CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING, ETC]. The value of these programs to American citizens far outweighs the tiny savings to the deficit their cuts would bring.\\

**SHARE YOUR PERSONAL STORY OR VIEWPOINT ON ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS**
