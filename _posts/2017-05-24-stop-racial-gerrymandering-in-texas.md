Monday’s Supreme Court ruling striking down two North Carolina congressional districts for gerrymandering to discriminate based on race has big implications for Texas. Lawmakers and other experts agree that the Court is sending Texas a message that if we don’t fix our own districts, they’ll do it for us. Shortly after the SCOTUS hearing, Judge Xavier Rodriguez, one of the three federal district court judges that ruled on Texas’s gerrymandering case, urged the state to consider whether it should “voluntarily undertake redistricting in a special session” of the Legislature. He gave lawmakers until Friday 5/26 to decide.

**CALL Rep. Cindy Burkett**, R-Sunnyvale and chair of the House Redistricting Committee, and tell her we must put a stop to racial gerrymandering in Texas. Urge her to hold a hearing about the matter; her committee hasn’t met once this legislative session! Tell her you’re in favor of a special session to redraw districts. **Extra credit: CALL Speaker of the House Joe Straus, Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, and Governor Greg Abbott and demand a special legislative session to redraw districts and end racial gerrymandering in Texas.**
