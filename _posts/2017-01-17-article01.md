Hey TX-10ers! There's a broad movement of concerned Texans planning meetings with their senators’ offices about the ACA repeal, and **we need you**! TX-10 has an appointment with a staffer at Sen. Cornyn's downtown office Wednesday at 3PM (But any constituents of Sen. Cornyn are encouraged to join us!). We’ll be meeting in front of the 6th street entrance at 2:30. Please come share your concerns about the repeal effort, your stories about how the ACA has affected you personally, or just to be there silently as a show of moral support.

We’d like to have an idea of how many people will show up, so if you think you can make it, let us know by contacting us at [contact@tx10indivisible.us](mailto:contact@tx10indivisible.us).
