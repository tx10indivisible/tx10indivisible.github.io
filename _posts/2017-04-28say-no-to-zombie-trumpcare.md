(It looks like Republicans do not have enough votes to pass this horrid bill before the weekend, but they are leaving open the possibility of voting on it next week, so let's make sure McCaul spends his weekend thinking about how angry his constituents will be if he votes yes!)

The AHCA is back and it’s even worse for the American people than before. The bill would result in 24 million people losing their health insurance coverage by 2026. It would cut more than $800 billion from Medicaid and eliminate critical funding for prevention and public health. Additionally, the new proposal allows insurers not cover essential health benefits, to charge people higher premiums based on pre-existing conditions, and increase out-of-pocket costs for older adults if states opt out of those provisions.

Instead of bringing this monstrosity back to life, members of Congress should work together in a bipartisan manner to build upon the ACA.

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Congressman McCaul's. President Trump is trying to resurrect the failed AHCA by making it even worse for America. I’m calling on representative McCaul to do right by the American people and make a public statement opposing the bill.
