Call Representative McCaul to commend his support of childhood cancer treatment, but **demand that he vote NO on the Obamacare replacement** so that families can afford the treatment he champions.

As founder of the Childhood Cancer Caucus, Rep. McCaul introduced the RACE for Children Act on February 27th, which could help find new medications for pediatric cancers. However, the American Health Care Act that House Republicans are proposing to replace the ACA would cause families to be unable to pay for these medications and will either be left bankrupt or without the treatment at all.

The AHCA as currently proposed would offer a tax credit of $2000 to $4000 a year to pay for health care, which would not come close to the market price. The individual mandate would no longer be enforced, causing a “death spiral” where many people choose not to purchase health insurance until they are sick, which then causes premiums to skyrocket. The Medicaid expansion would be gradually rolled back.

**Call Congressman McCaul and show support for the RACE for Children Act but demand that he vote NO on the American Health Care Act (Obamacare)**. If this legislation passes, life-saving drugs like those targeted in this bill will be unattainable for the thousands of children diagnosed with cancer each year.
