Yesterday, Trump took the extraordinary and unprecedented step of firing an FBI Director who was currently leading an investigation into his administration. This is a frightening, authoritarian abuse of power, but also an act of desperation. Make no mistake, **THIS IS A MISSTEP BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.** They just put Russia back in the headlines for weeks and almost instantly prompted lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to call for an independent investigation into Russia's meddling in our election. They have inadvertently provided us with our best opportunity yet to push the needle--**AND WE NEED TO ACT ON IT.**

So, **we are asking all TX-10ers to make THREE phone calls today: to Rep. McCaul, Sen. Cornyn, and Sen. Cruz, DEMANDING an independent investigation into Russia's election interference and possible collusion by the Trump campaign.** Remember that Nixon's firing of the special prosecutor tasked with investigating him was the overreach that preceded his downfall. We can help hold him accountable. **THE TRUTH WILL OUT.**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT

>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of [Rep. McCaul/Sen. Cornyn/Sen. Cruz] and I am deeply disturbed by the firing of FBI director James Comey, in light of the FBI's current investigation of the Trump administration's possible collusion with Russia. If an American president can fire any official who is investigating his administration for wrongdoing, then the very fabric of our democracy is in jeopardy. That's why I'm asking my representative to rise above partisan politics and demand an independent investigation into the Russian interference with our election. Thank you.
