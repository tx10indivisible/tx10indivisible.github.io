Despite all the partisanship and division in America lately, there was one issue that liberals and conservatives were starting to agree on: **that America was incarcerating too many of its citizens for too long.** Besides being an abuse of human rights, it costs taxpayers dearly, and it almost seemed as if the Senate was going to take bipartisan action on this issue--even our own Sen. John Cornyn was coming around--and then Jeff Sessions became Attorney General, and now he has instructed prosecutors across the country to seek the stiffest penalties possible for criminal defendants. This is a huge step backwards which Republicans in Congress that had previously supported criminal justice reform are spinelessly silent about. **Let them know that Sessions is way out of touch with the public on this issue and that we need Congress to take legislative action!**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT

>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Sen. [CRUZ OR CORNYN]. I am with the majority of Americans who believe that stiffer criminal penalties for drug violations have been a disaster that led to our shamefully high rates of incarceration. Jeff Sessions' order to exacerbate this problem with harsher sentencing can only be countered with legislative action. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have long agreed on this issue. I'm asking my senator to stand up to the Trump Administration and introduce criminal justice reform legislation NOW. Thank you.
