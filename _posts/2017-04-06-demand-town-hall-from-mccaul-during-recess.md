**CONGRESS 2-WEEK RECESS STARTS NEXT WEEK... WHEN'S THE TOWN HALL, REP. MCCAUL?**
Starting Friday, Congress will leave Washington for their first recess since February, and Rep. McCaul has still made no plans to meet with his constituents in a public setting. Call and let him know his so-called "tele-town hall" was not remotely adequate. **WE WANT A TOWN HALL!**

**CALL Representative McCAUL and TELL HIM not to use “tax reform” as an excuse to further enrich the wealthy on the backs of middle- and working-class Americans.**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Rep. McCaul. Rep. McCaul declined to attend a town hall during his last recess, claiming scheduling difficulty. It has now been months since he's been aware of the great demand in his district to speak with him in person. I urge him to respect the voices of his constituents and hold a town hall during the April recess. Thank you.
