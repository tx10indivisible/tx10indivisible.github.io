The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects the bill the House passed to repeal and replace Obamacare (the ACA) would increase the number of uninsured people by 23 million, and dramatically raise insurance premiums on the sick and elderly. All the gains in the number of insured Americans achieved by Obamacare would be wiped out, according to the CBO.

**Call Senators Cornyn and Cruz** and demand any Senate bill not strip needy Americans of health insurance!

**Call Representative McCaul** and express your disappointment in his vote for the AHCA.

## SAMPLE SCRIPT:
Include any personal story you have about the benefits of Medicaid, Obamacare or a pre-existing condition.

**Call Senators Cornyn and Cruz**\\
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of the Senator. I live in &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;. The CBO projects that the healthcare bill passed by the House would strip 23 million Americans of health insurance in order to fund a tax give away to millionaires! I am appalled. Do not support any bill that strips our sick and elderly of health insurance

**Call Representative McCaul**\\
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Representative McCaul. I live in &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;. I am appalled that Representative McCaul voted for the cruel and heartless AHCA bill that, according to the CBO projection, would strip 23 million Americans of health insurance in order to fund a tax give away to millionaires!
