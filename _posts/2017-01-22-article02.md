**CALL TODAY** and ask Senators Cornyn and Cruz to oppose Trump's corrupt and unqualified cabinet

Senate Republicans were trying to run Trump's appointments on a
fast track. Your phone calls these past two weeks have helped slow
down confirmations of the most corrupt, least qualified cabinet in
history. Let's keep it up.

Several cabinet nominees continue to have hearings and/or votes coming
up this week. On Monday weâ€™re encouraging everyone to pick a cabinet
nominee and call Sens. Cruz and Cornyn to register opposition. Pick your
(least) favorite, and make some calls!

Scripts for nearly all cabinet nominees are available here:

Sen. Ted Cruz

directly to a staffer. If phones are busy try again shortly. If you get
voicemail you can leave a message, but it's always better to talk to
a staffer.
