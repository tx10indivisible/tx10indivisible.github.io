The Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) is an important safeguard for American workers. Its regulations don’t just apply to those whose jobs require physical labor—nearly all Americans who hold jobs are protected by OSHA regulations. This joint resolution would limit OSHA’s ability to cite employers who violate workplace injury and illness requirements. Currently, when an employer violates record-keeping requirements, OSHA has up to 66 months from the time of violation to cite or impose a penalty.

**However, if H.J.Res 83 passes the Senate, OSHA’s jurisdiction would be limited to six months after the records violation occurred.** This joint resolution effectively decreases OSHA’s ability to hold employers in violation of records-keeping requirements from five years from the date of violation to just six months. This puts workplace safety at risk, because **employers will have little incentive to keep records: it’s unlikely that an already over-extended OSHA will be able to catch infractions in this extremely short timeframe.**

The House has passed H.J. Res 83, but the bill still needs to clear the Senate. Tell your Senators that you support American workers and oppose H.J.Res 83.
