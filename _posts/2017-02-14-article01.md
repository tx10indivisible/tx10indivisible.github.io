**Call Rep. McCaul** and urge him to put House Resolution 371, the
"Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act of 2017" up for a vote!

The president’s many conflicts of interest are once again front and
center. He has recently publicly attacked Nordstrom over a business
deal and his counselor Kellyanne Conway took advantage of an interview
on a news network to broadcast an infomercial on behalf of the Ivanka
Trump clothing line. Today, we even saw that wealthy members of his
Mar-a-Lago club ($200,000 for a membership) are entitled to front row
seats of national security meetings typically held in ultra-secure
locations. The "Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act of 2017"
sponsored by Representative Katherine Clark would require the president
to put his investments in a blind trust and cooperate in annual reports
on his financial interests. We need to put pressure on Representative
McCaul to put House Resolution 371 to a vote.
