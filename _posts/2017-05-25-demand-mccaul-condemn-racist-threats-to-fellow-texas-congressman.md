Congressman Al Green, of TX-09 just to the southeast of our TX-10, has received a number of racist threats in response to his call for impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump.

The quotes from the threatening calls are truly disquieting. From the Houston Chronicle:

>"You ain't going to impeach nobody. Try it and we will lynch all of you," a caller said in one of several threatening recordings the Houston Democrat played at a town hall meeting Saturday. "You'll be hanging from a tree," the caller continued.

These sentiments are beyond objectionable. They are not just contrary to the friendly nature that is the best of Texas, they are disgusting and vile. They are directed not only towards Congressman Green but against our friends and neighbors who he represents and we will not condone or ignore them.  And, we will demand our Representative Michael McCaul join us in our anger and outrage. Setting politics aside, we appeal to his common human decency to condemn these ugly racist threats.

**If Rep. McCaul joins us in condemning racist threats to Rep. Al Green, then we owe him public thanks.** If possible make a note of Rep. McCaul's staff's response to your concerns, and if he commits to a public condemnation consider posting a Facebook message or a tweet of thanks.
Also, if you'd like, briefly call Rep. Al Green's office, thank him and his staff for their courage in the face of these threats, and their efforts to consider impeachment proceedings against the law-breaking, corrupt and incompetent president.

## SAMPLE SCRIPT:
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Representative McCaul. I live in &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;. I read recently that another Texas member of Congress, Representative Al Green, has recently received racist, violent, threatening phone calls for his call for impeachment proceedings against the president. His district borders ours and his constituents are our neighbors. [Share how these overt, violent, racist threats concern you as a citizen and a Texan.] Does Representative McCaul oppose this disgusting behavior? And if so, will he make a public statement to that effect? Thank you.
