Congressional Recess is fast approaching. With Congressman McCaul returning to Texas, we should be encouraging him to meet with his constituents.

**CALL Congressman McCAUL to inquire about when he plans to meet IN PERSON with his constituents.**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Representative McCaul. I am calling to see when the Congressman plans to hold a real, in-person town hall with his constituents. In light of many of the changes being proposed by Congress and the White House, we deserve to have face time with our elected official to express concern and ask questions about these changes. Can you tell me when there will be an opportunity to meet with Congressman McCaul? Thank you for your time.
