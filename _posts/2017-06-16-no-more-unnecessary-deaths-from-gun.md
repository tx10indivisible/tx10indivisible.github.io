On Wednesday, the 154th mass shooting of the year took place in the US. This shooting, however, garnered more attention because it was directed at our legislators in Washington. The injuries and death from this event are tragic, but no more tragic than the countless other gun deaths and injuries that occur all over the country because of lax gun regulation. Because of this event, however, it seems that some legislators might be more receptive to hearing the case for stricter gun regulation.

Call Representative Michael McCaul and express your outrage that more than 12,000 people die each year in the United States from gun homicides. That on average 93 Americans are killed each day with guns. That seven children and teens are killed with guns in the US every day. That America’s gun homicide rate is more than 25 TIMES the average of other developed countries. That these statistics are not just numbers, they are lives. And it is not just the lives of those killed that are affected, but also all of the lives that person touched. That this is unacceptable and action must be taken NOW. NO MORE UNNECESSARY GUN DEATHS!

## SAMPLE SCRIPT:

> Hi, I’m a constituent of Representative McCaul. My name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I live in &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;. I want to make Rep. McCaul aware how outraged I am that we are STILL not taking necessary action on gun regulation as a state or as a country. How many more people need to die? We have a responsibility to increase Americans’ sense of safety and security, not by arming more people, but by making it MUCH more difficult for people with criminal histories, domestic violence backgrounds, or mental health issues from getting access to firearms.
