The Washington Post has reported that Attorney General Jeff Sessions misled the Senate during his confirmation hearing about having contact with Russia as a Trump campaign surrogate. Since he is now tainted by his conduct, a special prosecutor must be named to get to the bottom of the Trump administration’s many questionable ties to Russia. Sen. Lindsay Graham has already called for a special prosecutor and other Republicans may be on the verge of following suit--**LET'S PUT THE PRESSURE ON!**

CALL senators CRUZ and CORNYN as well as representative McCAUL and insist that they join the call for an independent council to investigate the administration’s ties to Russia.
