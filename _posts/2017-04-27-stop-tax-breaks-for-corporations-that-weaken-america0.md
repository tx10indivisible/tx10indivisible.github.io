The White House and far-right Republicans are hammering out a new health care repeal bill that may be voted on as early as TOMORROW. This one is even more cruel and draconian than the AHCA, designed to appease the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus by eliminating protections for people with pre-existing conditions, Medicaid funding, and other essential health benefits. That means we need to put pressure on moderate Republicans to VOTE NO!

**Call McCaul today (and tomorrow!) and tell him you strenuously oppose this bill.**  Share your personal experience with ACA if you can. Stress the importance of protections for people with pre-existing conditions, as that is one of the most popular parts of ACA and its elimination will not go down well with any of his constituents, Republican or Democrat. They need to feel the pressure again!

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Rep. McCaul. I am calling to urge him to vote NO on the new far-right health care bill. Tens of millions of Americans would lose health care under this plan and people with preexisting conditions like cancer and diabetes would be left out in the cold. Not only is it cruel, but it eliminates or weakens provisions of the ACA that are highly popular with the American people. [SHARE YOUR PERSONAL STORY].
