Mr. McCaul voted against forcing the release of Donald Trump's tax returns. On this day when all of us must pay up, let's talk about that and the budget priorities of the congressman. Cutting Planned Parenthood to fuel more Tomahawk missiles? Paying ICE to deport those who harvest our crops? Building an unnecessary wall? All are budget issues. Pick your favorite and join us at McCaul's Austin office to see if he or anyone from his staff will be available to discuss these issues with us. Bring letters, bring kids. Peaceful, civil discussion of the issues.

TUESDAY, APRIL 18th\\

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Representative McCaul's. The President of the United States should be mandated to release his tax returns to the public. Not requiring this action is a strong indication of the concealment of corrupt practices that make him unfit to lead this nation as commander and chief. The postponement of the tax return release is unacceptable and Representative McCaul should join those SUPPORTING THE RELEASE of TRUMP's TAX RETURNS.
