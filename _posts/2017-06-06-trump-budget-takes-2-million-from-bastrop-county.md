Federal budget cuts could slash $2 million from infrastructure projects in Bastrop, Elgin and Smithville. This much needed funding is in jeopardy due to Trump's axing of the 43 year old Community Development Block Grant Program. Ask Rep. McCaul to take a stand and defend this program that is so important in his district.

## SAMPLE SCRIPT:
> My name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I was stunned to learn that $2 million in federal grants to water, wastewater and road infrastructure projects for Bastrop, Elgin and Smithville are being slashed in Trump's budget. Will Congressman McCaul publicly support these funds and show us the concrete steps he is taking to restore them?
