Amid threats by Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick of a special legislative session over the “bathroom bill,” the Texas House on Sunday took a last-minute vote and approved a proposal that would keep transgender students from using school bathrooms in line with their gender identity.

Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick is hell-bent on making transgender kids into scary villains. His witch hunt against them is wrong and abusive. In North Carolina a similar wrong-headed attack on transgender people backfired – expensively – for former Governor Pat McCrory. Even with the history of legal and financial losses, Patrick continues his obsession, ignoring the voices of Texas’s business, civic and education leaders about sensible, proven ways to protect everyone’s privacy in restrooms.

There is no reason to target transgender people and prevent them from using the restroom which conforms to their gender identity other than plain meanness and to score cheap political points with bigots.

**CALL Lieutenant Governor Patrick and tell him that Texas is a friendly state that believes in limited government and that it’s not any business of his to dictate to schools what their transgender bathroom policy should be.**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT

>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a citizen of Texas. I am calling to express my disgust with Lieutenant Governor Patrick and his witch hunt against transgender youth. Things are hard enough for these kids and it’s shameful to use them as a political punching bag. Our school administrators know far more about their schools than he does and he shouldn’t interfere with local control and decision making regarding how best to serve all their students including the transgender ones.
