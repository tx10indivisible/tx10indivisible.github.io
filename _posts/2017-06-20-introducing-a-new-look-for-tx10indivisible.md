Today we released a new look to the TX-10 Indivisible Website.  Here is a bit more information about what has changed and why.

## WHAT'S NEW

* **Improved Mobile Experience** - Adopted a new template which makes the mobile UI much more user friendly.  Now ALL MoC contact details are available in the **Get Involved** navigation bar, *on every page*.

* **Improved Getting Involved Sections** - Consolidated and clarified ways for people to [Get Involved](/get-involved) at multiple levels.

* **Updated Overall Site Brand** - Site branding now matches more closely with TX-10 Indivisible.

## WHAT'S CHANGING

* **News Posts** - Under our new structure, we will stop posting daily actions on our website, but rather success stories and outcomes from actions when appropriate.  We will continue to post daily calls-to-action on our [**public** Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/tx10indivisible) where anyone can read and take action, with or without a Facebook account.  These actions will still be visible on our [Home Page &gt; TX-10 Calls to Action](/), or visible via [@tx10indivisible](https://twitter.com/tx10indivisible).

## FEEDBACK
Please let us know if you experience any trouble with the new website.  Whether it's on our mobile phone, laptop or home computer, our goal is to insure that the tools you need to take action and resist in TX-10 are always at your fingertips!
