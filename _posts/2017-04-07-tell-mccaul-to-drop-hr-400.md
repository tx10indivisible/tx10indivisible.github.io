On Friday March 30th, Congressman McCaul signed on as a co-sponsor of H.R. 400 the “Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act.” If enacted, this law would remove significant federal funding from the City of Austin and Travis County.

Trump’s executive order on immigration directs Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to execute “the immigration laws of the United States against *all* removable aliens”—not just criminals. “Sanctuary” cities are municipalities that decline to hold people based on voluntary retainers without due process. Sally Hernandez the Travis County sheriff is not breaking any laws, and is not releasing violent immigrant offenders. This legislation is both harmful and unnecessary, and it interferes with local law enforcement’s ability to effectively police their communities.

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Representative McCaul from zip code ____. I would like to ask him to drop his sponsorship of H.R. 400. This legislation would have a profoundly negative impact on many constituents in his district. By supporting this bill, Rep. McCaul is aligning himself with Trump over his constituents and his own local community. Thank you.
