News organizations are reporting that Republicans have enough votes to
to carry the AHCA and will vote on it tomorrow.

IT'S TIME TO "BRING IT." Your best argument for healthcare. You know
exactly what to do. Fill the phone lines. Visit the office. Let McCaul
know that May 4th 2017 is the day he guarantees himself a loss in the
next election by voting to strip healthcare from more than 24 million
vulnerable people. Report out if the lines aren't jammed when you call.
If the lines aren't busy all day we need to get more people to call.
