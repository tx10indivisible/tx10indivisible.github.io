CALL TO ACTION Wednesday May 3, 2017

Call and tell Sen. Cornyn that the Senate Intelligence Committee needs
to take the investigation into Russian interference with the November
election seriously!

73% of Americans agree that they want an independent, non-partisan
commission into the matter, similar to the 9/11 Commission. But unless
and until that is created, the Senate Intelligence Committee is what we
have. It currently has 2 full-time and 7 part-time staffers, compared
with 46 full-time staff for the Benghazi Committee and 181 for the
Iran-Contra investigation. The committee has not yet conducted
interviews with Trump associates suspected of having links to Russian
intelligence services. CALL and TELL Sen. Cornyn that the Russia probe
needs more resources!
