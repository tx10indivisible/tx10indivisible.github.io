McCaul is still in recess, so we're visiting his office again to share our concerns about his reactionary stance on immigration and support for punishing cities that have the audacity to decide their own law enforcement policies. Join us if you can at 3:30PM, or if you can't, call the office with your questions or concerns on this issue. It's the height of hypocrisy for a Texan who lives in Austin to want to punish his own community for not following the marching orders of his party leaders in Washington!

**TX-10 Indivisible is going to Representative McCaul's office:**\\
WEDNESDAY, APRIL 19th\\
3:30pm-5:00pm CDT\\
9009 Mountain Ridge Drive\\
Austin Building Suite 230\\
Austin, Texas 78759\\
