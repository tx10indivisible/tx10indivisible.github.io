Today, we organized a visit to Rep. Michael McCaul's Austin
office. Although Rep. McCaul currently is in Washington, we wanted to
talk to his staff to express our concerns over his position on Donald
Trump's Muslim and refugee ban.

Nearly 80 people showed up. We were supported by friends from [Refugee
Services of Texas in Austin](http://www.rstx.org/Austin.html) and
[Indivisible Austin](https://www.indivisibleaustin.com/).

People marched and chanted. His staffers came out to meet with the
group. For over an hour, people shared their letters and moving stories
with Rep. McCaul's staff.

We requested that when Rep. McCaul returns to Texas, he hold a town hall
to meet with his constituents and discuss issues of concern. If you agree,
call Rep. McCaul this week and ask him to hold a town hall.

Thanks to everybody who came out today. We're working on more events. In
the meantime, continue calling and visiting your representatives and
press your position. We will be heard!

Here's video from the event.
