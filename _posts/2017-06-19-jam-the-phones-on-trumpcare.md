CALL TO ACTION - Thursday, June 15

If TrumpCare gets through the Senate, it will probably become law. If the Senate manages to jam it through, there’ll be nothing left to stop it from getting to Trump’s desk.

Call your Senator’s DC office and ask to speak to the health staffer by name. For Sen. Cornyn, that’s Beth Nelson; For Sen Cruz, it’s Joel Heimbach.

Only 8% of Americans want TrumpCare to pass. Most of us at this point have become acutely aware of the number “23 million” as in 23 million will lose coverage over the next decade if this bill passes. In Texas this will be 2,516,300 people. For those of us who do not immediately lose coverage in Texas it will mean an average premium increase of $691. So the only way for the Senate to pass this cruel and unpopular piece of legislation is through sabotage, speed and secrecy. By rattling insurers, the GOP has destabilized the insurance market, already causing premiums to rise (sabotage). They hope to pass the bill before July 4 recess to minimize pressure on the politicians whose Senate seats are particularly vulnerable (speed). And the changes that are being made by the Senate to the disastrous House bill are being made in secret. We can’t know exactly what they have in store. However, our own John Cornyn said “80 percent of what the House did [in the AHCA bill] we’re likely to do.” This can only mean that Medicaid cuts will be severe and Americans with pre-existing conditions will once again find the coverage costs prohibitive.

(We've also heard that Republican staffs really don't like it when you call it "Trumpcare," so let's use the word often!)


## SAMPLE SCRIPT:

> Hi, I’d like to speak to Sen &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;'s legislative assistant about the American Health Care Act. I am a constituent of Sen &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;, my zip code is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;. I am among the 92% of Americans who do not want the AHCA to pass. Obamacare needs to be improved upon, but it has not failed. I ask that the Senator consider the well-being of his constituents and vote NO on the AHCA.
