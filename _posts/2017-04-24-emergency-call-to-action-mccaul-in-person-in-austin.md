For the first time, TX-10 Indivisible has advance warning of an event that **Rep. McCaul will be appearing at in-person IN AUSTIN!** We have to act on it!
Tonight, Monday April 24th, Rep. McCaul will be speaking at an event for Catholic business leaders at The Austin Club at 9th and Congress in downtown Austin. **The event is scheduled from 6-9PM, so we're planning on meeting out front at 5:30PM. But even if you can't make it that early, come whenever you can! We'll be there!**

**BRING SIGNS** with your message for McCaul--about immigration, health care, the environment, or whatever other issue you're passionate about. I particularly think that pressure for a town hall will be an effective message for any press we can get there, as he will be inside meeting (yet again) with business leaders and donors instead of ordinary constituents.

I know this is last minute, but we've been waiting for an opportunity to voice our concerns directly to our congressman, so we cant pass this up! Tell your friends and neighbors who might be constituents as well, and if you need a ride, bring it up in the comments below and maybe we can get some carpools going. **HOPE TO SEE A BIG CROWD THERE!** This is what Indivisible is all about. **RESIST**.
