**CALL TODAY** and ask Sen. Cornyn and Sen. Cruz to oppose Betsy DeVos for Education Secretary

_[Note: this is the second of two actions for today. If you haven't already, please consider
taking action to [oppose Steve Bannon](/2017-02-05-article02).]_

The confirmation vote for Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education will happen _any day now_.
Two Republicans have flipped their votes to _no_ on her.
We are just one vote away from getting her nomination blocked.

Please call Senators Cornyn and Cruz _today_ to oppose her nomination.

You can read more about why DeVos is such a terrible nominee, as well as sample phone scripts, at the _Indivisible Austin_ site:

### Contact Info

Sen. John Cornyn

* Central Texas office: 512-469-6034
* Washington, DC office: 202-224-2934

Sen. Ted Cruz

* Central Texas office: 512-916-5834

Best to call during normal business hours to increase chances of speaking
directly to a staffer. If phones are busy try again shortly. If you get
voicemail you can leave a message, but it's always better to talk to
a staffer.
