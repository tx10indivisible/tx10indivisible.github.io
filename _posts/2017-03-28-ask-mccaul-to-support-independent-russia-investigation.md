Representative DEVIN NUNES has shown on several occasions that he CANNOT BE IMPARTIAL as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee investigating the administration's ties to Russia during and after the 2016 election. He has repeatedly stated that there is no evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia before the investigation is completed, and despite circumstantial evidence to the contrary. He was a member of Donald Trump’s transition team, which is under investigation by the committee he chairs. On March 22, Nunes held two press conferences, briefed the Republican Speaker of the House and the Republican President, all before he briefed the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee and the rest of the Committee members. The evidence he publicly discussed during those briefings has still not been shown to the other members of the House Intelligence Committee.

**Call representative McCaul and ask him to PUBLICLY SUPPORT an INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION into the Trump administration's TIES TO RUSSIA!**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>My name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; a constituent of representative McCaul. I am calling to urge him to take a public stand in calling for an independent commission to investigate possible collusion between the Trump team and the Russians. Devin Nunes’ apparent coordination with the White House last Wednesday demonstrate that he and the the House Intelligence Committee cannot oversee an impartial investigation. Collusion and meddling in our presidential election by a foreign power is not a partisan issue and I am asking that representative McCaul publicly call for an independent investigation.
