Beside the fact that Congressional Republicans stole this Supreme Court seat from Barack Obama in an act of unprecedented obstructionism, Neil Gorsuch is an extreme right-wing judge far outside the mainstream, who has repeatedly sided with corporations and Wall Street over the interests of ordinary Americans. Though it is unlikely that Sen. Cornyn or Cruz will break with party on this nomination, we need to let them know they do so against the will of their constituents!

**CALL Senators Cornyn &amp; Cruz to Oppose Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court!**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Sen. [Cruz or Cornyn]. I am calling to register my opposition to Neil Gorsuch's nomination for the Supreme Court. The people of America on both sides of the aisle have made it clear they are fed up with Washington's pro-Wall Street mentality, and Judge Gorsuch has consistently sided with corporations over the interests of ordinary citizens. Our already polarized nation deserves a moderate Supreme Court nominee who will represent more than just the CEOs and billionaires of America. Thank you.
