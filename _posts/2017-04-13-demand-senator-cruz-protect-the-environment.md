Trump's budget proposal includes a 30% CUT to the EPA - eliminating funding for the Clean Power Plan, regulations on greenhouse gas emissions and research for climate change. The proposal also includes a 12% CUT to the Dept of Interior which protects our national parks, fish and wildlife and natural resources. Senator Cruz has been quoted as commending Trump for his efforts to roll back Obama-era environmental regulations. We can't let this happen.

**TX-10 Indivisible is going to Senator Cruz's office THURSDAY, APRIL 13th @ NOON to protect the EPA.** If you cannot attend, support our in-person action by amplifying the message that the EPA is important and must be preserved with your phone calls. **WE MUST protect the environment and stop Trump.**

**CALL Senator Cruz and DEMAND PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND OUR NATURAL RESOURCES!**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Senator Cruz's. The EPA performs a critical function in protecting the environment. The Trump budget calls for a 30% cut to the EPA. This is unacceptable and Senator Cruz should join those SUPPORTING THE EPA and PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT.
