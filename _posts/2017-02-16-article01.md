title: Demand REP. McCAUL PUBLICLY SUPPORT a Congressional investigation into Trump’s Russia ties
subtitle: CALL TO ACTION for Thursday, Feb. 16

This is not a scandal anymore. It’s a full-blown crisis. In early
January, Rep. Michael McCaul said that Trump’s relationship to
Russia "deserves investigation, but he hasn’t made any further
statement since the resignation of Gen. Flynn and new revelations
that Trump’s aides were in constant communication with Russian
intelligence during the campaign. Democrats and some Republicans
are publicly calling for congressional investigations, and as
chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, it would be a massive
step forward if Rep. McCaul joined them.

CALL REP. McCAUL and ask him to PUBLICLY SUPPORT a bipartisan
Congressional investigation into Trump's ties to Russia.
