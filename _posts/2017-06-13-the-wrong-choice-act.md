Call to Action Tuesday June 13th, 2017

The GOP may want to forget the devastating financial crisis that crashed the economy, but the American people haven't. The Trump administration is working to roll back consumer protection regulations passed after the mortgage crisis decimated our economy during the last recession. The House has passed legislation rolling back these protections on Thursdayâ€“now it heads to the Senate. Misnamed the "Financial choice act" it removes restrictions on risky speculative trading by banks and repeals the requirements that banks operate in their client's best interest.

## SAMPLE SCRIPT:
> Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I live in Texas. I believe that legislation like Dodd-Frank can prevent the types of abuse of our financial system that caused in the mortgage crisis and the catastrophic recession that ensued. Will the Senator commit to keeping those protections in place and vote against the Financial Choice Act? America cannot afford another recession and bailout.
