As you may have heard, we've had an overwhelmingly positive response to tonight's town hall. In fact, the response has been so positive that we have 500 RSVPs for a venue that seats 300. Uh-oh! The last thing we want to do is turn people away, and we are doing everything we can to accommodate as many people as physically possible! That said, there's no way around it: space is probably going to be an issue, and we recommend getting there early to get a seat.

In an effort to help with this capacity constraint--and to reach TX-10 constituents outside of the Austin area--we'll be streaming the event via Facebook Live on our new public Facebook page. If you'd like to view the event in this way, just "like" the page and tune in a few minutes before 6:30. If you have friends, neighbors, or colleagues in TX-10 who would be interested in the Facebook Live event, please help us share this information.

Thank you guys SO much for your outpouring of engagement. We look forward to seeing everyone there in-person and here online!
