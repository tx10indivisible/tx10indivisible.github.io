Senate Republicans denied President Obama his constitutional right to nominate a Supreme Court Justice in the last year of his term, claiming that it would be improper to vote on a nominee before hearing the will of the people in the forthcoming presidential election. By that rationale, it should certainly be improper to confirm the Supreme Court nominee of a president who did not win the popular vote, and is currently under investigation by the FBI for potentially colluding with a foreign power to subvert the electoral process. Even disregarding these unprecedented conditions, Neil Gorsuch is an extremist with views far outside the mainstream, who consistently sides with corporations and wealthy individuals over ordinary Americans. Call your Senators and tell them you OPPOSE Neil Gorsuch's nomination, and urge them to forsake the so-called "nuclear option" which would end the filibuster and make Neil Gorsuch the only justice to ascend to the highest court in the land without a filibuster-proof majority.

**CALL SEN. CORNYN AND CRUZ AND TELL THEM YOU OPPOSE NEIL GORSUCH'S NOMINATION TO THE SUPREME COURT AND URGE THEM NOT TO SUPPORT THE SO-CALLED "NUCLEAR OPTION" TO END THE FILIBUSTER.**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Sen. [Cornyn or Cruz], and I am calling to register my opposition to Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. Gorsuch is a right-wing extremist who consistently sides with billionaires and corporations over working Americans. Furthermore, I will consider any "nuclear option" to end the filibuster to be an anti-democratic power grab that radically changes the process by which every Supreme Court Justice has been confirmed. Put country over party and keep our democratic system of checks and balances in place.
