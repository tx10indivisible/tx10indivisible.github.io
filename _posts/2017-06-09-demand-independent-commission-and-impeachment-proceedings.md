James Comey’s testimony confirms that Donald Trump tried to obstruct justice. The President of the United States knew that the FBI was investigating his associates, TRIED TO STOP THAT INVESTIGATION, and then fired the person who wouldn’t stop it. This is obstruction of justice, a federal crime, and an impeachable offense.

Ask Representative Michael McCaul to support the creation of an independent commission to continue investigating alleged obstruction of justice, Russian interference in our democracy, and Russian collusion with the Trump campaign and administration. Ask Representative Michael McCaul to support a House Resolution for impeachment.

Ask Senators Cruz and Cornyn to support the creation of an independent commission to continue investigations.

I'm calling today because James Comey’s testimony confirms that Donald Trump tried to obstruct justice. The President of the United States knew that the FBI was investigating his associates, TRIED TO STOP THAT INVESTIGATION, and then fired the person who wouldn’t stop it. This is obstruction of justice, a federal crime, and an impeachable offense.
I urge Representative McCaul to join over 190 house members to support a discharge petition and force a vote on the Swalwell-Cummings bill called Protecting our Democracy Act HR356 which would establish an independent commission to investigate Russian interference in our democracy.
Also, I urge Representative McCaul to support a house resolution for impeachment and begin impeachment proceedings.
Representative McCaul must place protecting our democracy before protecting the Trump administration.
Thank you for your time.

I urge my Senator to join 26 others and cosponsor Senator Ben Cardin’s bill, S.27, to establish a commission of independent experts to examine the facts regarding Russia and the 2016 election.
