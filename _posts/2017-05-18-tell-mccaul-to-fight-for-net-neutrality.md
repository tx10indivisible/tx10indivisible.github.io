The Federal Communications Commission voted along party lines (2-1) on Thursday to begin unraveling the net neutrality regulations put in place in 2015 under President Obama. These regulations have been some of the most strict to date to ensure the internet remains a resource that does not favor particular companies which have the ability to pay for higher speeds and more attention towards their websites.

The FCC's Chairman, Ajit Pai, is strongly in favor of this big-business friendly approach. What needs to be voiced by constituents country-wide, are concerns about the effect these looser regulations will have on the consumer and on small-business enterprises.

**CALL Representative McCAUL and urge him to reject looser regulations and express your belief that the internet should remain free and open.**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT

>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Representative McCaul. I am calling to express my deep concern about the effect rolling back net neutrality regulations will have on consumers as well as small businesses. Loosening the regulatory framework of the internet would have lasting and consequential effects that would strongly favor big business and monied interests. I urge Representative McCaul to stand firm against the regulatory rollback. Thank you.
