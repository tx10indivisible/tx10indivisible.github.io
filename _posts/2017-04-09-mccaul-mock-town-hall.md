We're holding an IN PERSON- MOCK TOWN HALL at Rep McCaul’s Austin Office - TUESDAY APRIL 11th, 2017 @ NOON - 1:30PM

For more info and RSVP see the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1434772543497184/)

## TOPIC

Rep. McCaul begins his two-week recess this week, and despite thousands of phone calls, emails and office visits, he has STILL not scheduled a town hall to hear the voices of his constituents. (And, NO, a “tele-town hall” with canned statements and pre-screened questions does not count.) So, we are going to his office TUESDAY, APRIL 11th @ NOON to ask our questions anyway. Hopefully a staffer will come out to take notes, but if not, we’ll still record the event (for those who wish to be recorded), collect the questions and make sure that McCaul’s office sees it all and feels obliged to respond. Let’s make sure his recess starts with a big “WE’RE STILL HERE!”

## WHAT TO BRING

Since this is a mock town hall, write a letter that you’d read at a McCaul’s town hall if he were to have one. Make your letter personal and end it with your question for Rep. McCaul. You don’t have to speak if you don’t want to, supporting others willing to speak is just as important. Also, bring a sign relevant to your topic or one just asking for a town hall. And as always, Children and babies are welcome!

## WHERE

Rep. Michael McCaul’s Austin Office<br>
9009 Mountain Ridge Drive<br>
Austin Building, Suite 230<br>
Austin, TX 78759

We’ll meet in the office park parking lot at NOON promptly. Just an FYI: It’s a corporate office park off 360, so it’s a bit hidden. There is plenty of parking in the building lot and on the street.

## WHEN: TUESDAY APRIL 11TH @ NOON

LET’S LET HIS OFFICE KNOW WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN!! IF HE CAN’T GIVE US A TOWN HALL, WE’LL BRING IT TO HIM!
