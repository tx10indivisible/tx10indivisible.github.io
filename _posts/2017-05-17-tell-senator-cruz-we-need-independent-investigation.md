In an interview Tuesday, Sen. Ted Cruz says he wants to “wait and withhold judgement” about Trump revealing highly sensitive classified intelligence to Russian officials. Trump’s actions are inexcusable, and the nation can no longer afford to give him more chances.

CALL Senator CRUZ and tell him the nation needs an independent, 9/11-style commission to look into the Trump Administration’s ties to Russia. Our national security is at grave risk due to these reckless disclosures. Our allies cannot trust us, our sources cannot safely work with us, and our intelligence community cannot operate effectively when the President reveals state secrets to hostile foreign powers. 78% of Americans would rather the investigation was handled by an outside commission than Congress.
