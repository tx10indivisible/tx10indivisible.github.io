Happy Martin Luther King Day!

Rep. McCaul's office is closed on Monday, so he gets a break from hearing from us. ;)

But many of us in the TX-10 will be joining the MLK March and Festival tomorrow! Check out the link for details, get some friends together and let's show the world that one electoral college loss can't dampen the American people's dedication to civil rights and justice!
