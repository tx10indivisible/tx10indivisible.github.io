Michael McCaul is beating the drums for war. Last week, he expressed repeatedly his belief that the U.S. should lead the effort to forcibly remove Assad from power and rebuild Syria. Incredibly, he offers no actual plan for achieving this other than to "hopefully work with the Russians" because they probably don't want a conflict with the U.S. We have a president whose ties to Russian intelligence are currently under investigation by the FBI. We have a electorate deeply skeptical of military intervention in the Middle East after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet we have a congressman who seems to think his job is to be a cheerleader for unilateral executive power rather than a check on it. Call and remind Rep. McCaul that his duty is to demand congressional approval for any military action by the president!

**CALL Representative McCAUL and TELL REP. MCCAUL TO INSIST ON CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL FOR MILITARY ACTION!**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Rep. McCaul. I am concerned by his recent statements calling for American military intervention in Syria without demanding Congressional approval. Any initiation of war with Syria, especially sending American ground troops in as McCaul has implied, is a serious decision that should be debated by Congress and the American people. To not demand Congressional approval for any further military acts by the Trump administration would be a violation of his office and the Constitutional system of checks and balances. Thank you.
