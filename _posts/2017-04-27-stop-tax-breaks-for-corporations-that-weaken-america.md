President Trump has proposed slashing America's corporate and business tax rates to 15%. This will lower government revenues and increase the deficit along with the national debt. Additionally Trump's plan to increase military spending and build a wall will add billions to the budget. **Ask Congressman McCaul where he stands on Trump's plan to balloon the national debt.**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Representative McCaul's. What is Congressman McCaul's position on the national debt and will he stand for fiscal responsibility? [Listen to the answer.] I would like the Congressman to know that I am opposed to huge tax breaks for corporations that will weaken America's financial position by increasing the national debt.
