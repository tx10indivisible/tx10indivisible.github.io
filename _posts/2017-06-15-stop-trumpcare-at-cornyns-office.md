IN-PERSON - CALL TO ACTION - SEN. CORNYN’S CENTRAL TEXAS OFFICE - THURSDAY JUNE 15TH 2017 @ 2PM

## TOPIC

We're organizing a rally at Senator Cornyn’s downtown Austin office, THURSDAY JUNE 15TH 2017 @ 2PM to demand that Senator Cornyn NOT repeal the Affordable Care Act.

Right now, the Senate is working behind closed doors to decide the future of our healthcare. Given what's at stake, this is an unconscionable process, but it's the process Senate Republicans have chosen. If TrumpCare gets through the Senate, it will probably become law. I know you’re tired. I know you’re frustrated. BUT THIS IS IT! This is our LAST chance to SAVE THE ACA!!!!

IF EVER THERE WERE A NEED TO SHOW UP IN PERSON, THIS IS IT!

## WHAT TO BRING

Write a personal letter about how the ACA has impacted your life. Include your concerns about Trumpcare and backdoor dealings. Bring the letter to read out loud or simply hand it to the senator’s staffer. You don’t have to speak if you don’t want to, supporting others is just as important. Bring a relevant protest sign. Bring your friends!!! Bring your children and babies!!!! Get the word out. We need BIG NUMBERS in attendance!!
