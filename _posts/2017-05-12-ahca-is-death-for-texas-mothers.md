Maternal mortality rates in the U.S. are appalling: since 2000, they have increased by more than 25%, putting us on par with countries like Qatar and Bahrain. The situation in Texas is especially desperate. Our maternity mortality rate *doubled* between 2011 and 2014. This is an emergency, and no one seems to be talking about it. Instead, Republicans at the capitol continue in their quest to decimate women’s healthcare. And as we all know, Michael McCaul voted for the AHCA, which would allow health insurance companies to opt out of covering basic services for women such as maternity care, well woman checks, and birth control. We need to **demand that McCaul explain why he voted for the AHCA, and ask him what he intends to do about Texas mothers dying at astonishing rates.**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT

>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Representative McCaul’s. I was deeply disappointed by the congressman’s vote in favor of the AHCA, which will have devastating effects on women’s healthcare. Is Rep. McCaul aware that Texas mothers die at a much higher rate than in any developed country in the world? The maternal mortality rate here doubled between 2011 and 2014. The AHCA will make it even worse. Why did Rep. McCaul vote for such a catastrophic policy? Is he just going to stand by while still more Texas mothers die?
