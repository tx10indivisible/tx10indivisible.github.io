As Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes has completely discredited the committee's ability to fairly investigate the Trump Administrations ties to Russia, many are saying intentionally so. Besides being a member of the Trump transition team, he has shown multiple times that his loyalties lie with the very people he is supposed to be investigating, so much so that Democrats and Republicans alike are calling for him to recuse himself. Yet he obstinately maintains his position, likely to able to control any damaging information on behalf of the Trump Administration. The very integrity of our system is at stake! Ask Rep. McCaul to join fellow Republicans in demanding that Nunes recuse himself from the Russia investigation!

**ASK REP. MCCAUL TO CALL FOR DEVIN NUNES TO RECUSE HIMSELF FROM RUSSIA INVESTIGATIONS!**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Rep. McCaul. I am urging him to join fellow Republicans in calling on Rep. Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation into Trump's ties to Russia. He has shown himself to be far too close to the very people he is supposed to be investigating, and already his actions on behalf of the Trump Administration call into question the very ability of the House of Representatives to act as a check on other branches of government. Thank you.
