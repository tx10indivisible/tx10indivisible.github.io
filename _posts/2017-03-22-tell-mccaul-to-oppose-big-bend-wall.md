Big Bend National Park is a shining jewel in the Texas parks system. If Trump succeeds in building a wall through it, its natural beauty will be desecrated. Wildlife obviously pay no attention to national borders and frequently cross back and forth. The re-introduction of the black bear to west Texas via Mexico is one of the great conservation stories of the Southwest, and it will end if a wall is built through the park. Very few people cross the border through the park due to the Chinati Mountains, so a wall does not improve national security in any way. But as a federal park, it does not need to be condemned lot by lot like other border regions, so it is a tempting target for Republicans who want to say they built something.

**CALL Representative McCAUL** and **TELL YOUR STORY** about what Big Bend or the natural beauty of Texas means to you personally. Staffers pay special attention to personal testimonials! Urge him to **SAY NO TO A WALL THROUGH BIG BEND.**
