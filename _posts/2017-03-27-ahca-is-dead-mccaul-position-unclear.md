The AHCA is dead, but some questions still need answering. A lot of McCaul's constituents heard from staffers that he was "leaning towards yes," but as far as we know, he has yet to make a public statement on the matter. This divisive, reckless bill was pulled without a vote specifically to spare House Republicans the political fallout of taking an unpopular position. Even though he was likely to obey the Trump administration, McCaul may be hoping that by never fully committing one way or the other, he can keep the AHCA from becoming an issue in future elections. Let's let him know that concealing his intentions from his constituents has a political price too! 

**CALL REP. MCCAUL'S OFFICES AND DEMAND THAT HE MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT ON HIS POSITION ON AHCA!**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Rep. McCaul. I'd like to know how he intended to vote on the American Health Care Act. I also urge him to make a public statement explaining his position. This bill would have drastically affected Texans' health and economy, and his constituents have a right to know how he intended to use the power we entrusted to him. Thank you.
