**WE'RE SO CLOSE!!!** They've postponed the vote a day to try to find enough "yeas" but apparently it didn't go very well, because Trump has threatened Republicans in Congress that he will leave Obamacare in place if they don't pass it today.

If that's not motivation to flood our Republican Congressman's phone line, I don't know what is! THIS IS IT! It's hard to overstate how big a win it would be for the resistance for this bill to fail!

The **house votes today on a revised version of the AHCA** that, in addition to leaving over 24 million Americans without health insurance, would significantly reduce coverage for the lucky few that could afford it. The **revised bill strips away the “essential health benefit” requirements that are present in the Affordable Care Act and insurers would no longer have to provide benefits such as maternity care, mental health care, preventative care, and emergency services. The revised CBO report predicts 24 million Americans would still lose coverage, AND it saves less money.**

**CALL AND DEMAND REP. MCCAUL VOTE NO ON THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT! Put the pressure on! Share your personal stories! If you called yesterday, CALL AGAIN!**


## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Congressman McCaul. I am calling to ask that he vote NO on the American Health Care Act. This bill is rushed, reckless, and harmful. If the AHCA passes, it will lead to significant reduction and even total loss of coverage for millions. The vast majority of Americans oppose it, along with every credible medical organization. We're counting on Rep. McCaul to put his constituents first. VOTE NO ON THE AHCA!"
