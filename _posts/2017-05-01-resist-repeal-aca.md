There's a LOT going on this week and we need your help!

Firstly, Republicans in the House are STILL trying to get a
vote on Trumpcare 2.0. For all its flaws, the ACA is one of
the biggest political accomplishment for working Americans
and we have to defend it! (It's also one of the most vulnerable
points for moderate Republicans, so you can't hammer them hard
enough on it!) Call Rep. McCaul today and urge him (AGAIN!)
to vote against this horrible repeal of the ACA that eviscerates
protections for patients with pre-existing conditions. He has
not yet taken a public stance on this bill, and we could make
him one of the couple of NO votes left needed to sink it!

ALSO... Early voting for the May 6 local elections in Bastrop,
Caldwell, Hays, Travis, and Williamson counties runs through
May 2, with Election Day on May 6. Getting more progessive voices
in local offices is ESSENTIAL to the Indivisible strategy and
a place where we have a lot of potential to make a difference!
So make sure to vote, and get the word out to your friends,
families and neighbors! Visit this link for more info on local
races and propositions:
