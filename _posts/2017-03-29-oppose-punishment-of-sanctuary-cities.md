Michael McCaul continues his fear-mongering rhetoric about undocumented immigrants and crime. Yesterday, he posted on Facebook and on his campaign Twitter  [@McCaulforTexas](https://twitter.com/McCaulForTexas) in support of Governor Abbott’s threats to jail Austin Sheriff Sally Hernandez for upholding sanctuary city policies. “Sanctuary cities endanger innocent Americans,” McCaul writes. This is just not true. A recent study by political scientist Tom K. Wong found that sanctuary counties have lower crime rates than comparable non-sanctuary counties. Immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the United States. Hardline immigration policies distract local law enforcement from keeping communities safe by pulling them into immigration crackdowns, and concurrently make immigrants fearful of calling police in the event of a crime.

**Call representative McCaul and tell him to let local law enforcement do their job and not force them to be Trump's immigration police!**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Representative McCaul. I am dismayed by the congressman’s support of Governor Abbott’s efforts to shut down sanctuary city policies and jail sheriffs like Sally Hernandez. There is no unauthorized immigrant crime wave. Sanctuary cities do not encourage crime. Undocumented immigrants are less likely to be criminals than natural-born American citizens. Governor Abbott's rhetoric encourages fear and scapegoating, and is not supported by the facts. McCaul should be listening to the needs of local Texas communities and law enforcement, instead of stripping us of our elected officials and forcing Trump's policies on us.
