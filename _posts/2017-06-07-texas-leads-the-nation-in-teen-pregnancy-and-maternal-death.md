After decades of GOP leadership, Texas has become the leader in teen pregnancies. GREAT NEWS! Dallas and San Antonio have rates 40 to 50% above the national average. In contrast, California put resources into education and access to contraceptives and their rates dropped by 74%. Texas implemented abstinence only programs. In addition, maternal deaths in Texas skyrocketed, a rate unrivaled not only in the United States, but in most of the developed world.

**Governor Abbott has called for a special session beginning the 18th of June. CALL your representatives and Governor Abbott and demand they stand up for Texas women's health.**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT:
> My name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am embarrassed that the Texas teen pregnancy rates are the highest in the country. The decision by the Texas GOP controlled legislature to put resources into abstinence only programs is a misguided failure that is costing us dearly. The lack of action over the skyrocketing rates of maternal deaths in Texas is unacceptable.
Will you commit to standing up for Texas women and addressing these issues by making maternal health, access to contraception, and effective sex education priorities?
