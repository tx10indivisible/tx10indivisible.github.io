Friday evening, Sen. John Cornyn went to Temple, Texas for a "Salute to
Business" banquet. We turned it into a "Salute to Democracy" protest.

We joined people from all over central Texas to rally at the event. The
protest was organized by the Bell County Democratic Party. Over 82 people
participated. We protested and screamed our heads off for nearly three
hours as people filed past us and into the event.

Bell County Democratic Chair, Chris Kelley Rosenberg was pleased with
the support.  She said, "This will help other Bell County Dems and
progressives not feel so alone, next time they'll come out and join
the fight."

All the local news coverage mentioned our protest. That's why these events
are important for our cause.  The local news coverage could have been a
celebration of Sen. Cornyn's event -- but we flipped the script and showed
everybody that residents are protesting and fighting for our democracy.

Thanks to everybody who came out.
