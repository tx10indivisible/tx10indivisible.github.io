title: CALL Representative McCaul today and demand an investigation into the Trump administration's ties to Russia!
subtitle: CALL TO ACTION for Wednesday, Feb. 15
tags: [action-alert]

UPDATE: Revelations last night that Trump aides' had sustained
contact with Russian intelligence during the campaign have
intensified this issue. Republicans in Congress are getting
close to taking action, but they still need our push!

The resignation of General Michael Flynn is an important first
step, but it provides no meaningful answers about the Trump
administration's apparent ties to Russia. Recent reporting makes
it clear that President Trump knew of Flynn's potential conflicts
and ties to Russia in January and failed to act. Because of this,
Flynn was granted high level security clearance even though he was
potentially compromised by a foreign state. As a nation, we cannot
turn a blind eye to this crisis of faith in our democratic
institutions brought on by the arrogance of the Trump administration.
