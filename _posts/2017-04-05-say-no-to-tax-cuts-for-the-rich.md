Call and tell Representative McCaul not to give tax cuts to the rich at the expense of the working and middle class!

Tax reform is a major priority for Republicans this year. The details are still being worked out, but the final plan is likely to include an end to the inheritance tax as well as major cuts to high-end individual taxes and corporate taxes. To make this unpopular giveaway palatable to the middle class, they will probably offer some minor concession to middle-income earners. It will also have to be revenue-neutral to satisfy the Freedom Caucus and to qualify for the budget reconciliation process. The most obvious way to make that happen is “entitlement reform” on the backs of the poor and working class.

**CALL Representative McCAUL and TELL HIM not to use “tax reform” as an excuse to further enrich the wealthy on the backs of middle- and working-class Americans.**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Representative McCaul from zip code ____. I am asking him to oppose any tax reform that primarily benefits the wealthy at the expense of hard-working working- and middle-class Americans. [ADD A STORY ABOUT WHY YOU ARE OPPOSED TO THIS PLAN.]

(And don't forget to ask whether McCaul plans to meet with his constituents during his April recess week!)
