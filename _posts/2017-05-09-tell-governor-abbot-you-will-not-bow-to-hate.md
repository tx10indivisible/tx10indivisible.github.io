SB 4 is the *“show me your papers”* law that will transform Texas into the new Arizona — for the worse. Today we will rise up in protests, community meetings and rallies in Austin and across the state to decry SB 4 for what it is — a racist law designed to target millions of Black and brown people, trample on our civil liberties and make our communities hide in fear.

If you cannot join the protest in person, please call the governor’s office and let him know you will not bow to hate, and you support local law enforcement in their struggle against federal and state over-reach.

## SAMPLE SCRIPT

>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a citizen of Texas. Governor Abbott was wrong to side with the federal government against local law enforcement and sign this racist law that makes our communities less safe.
