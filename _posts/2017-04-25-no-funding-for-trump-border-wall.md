A cornerstone of President Trump’s campaign was the promise that he would build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, claiming that the Mexican people who were emigrating here were “rapists” and “bad hombres.” Not only are President Trump’s characterizations of the Mexican community racist and incorrect, this wall he’s proposing comes with a massive estimated $25 billion-dollar price tag. Even though Trump has said many times that Mexico will pay for the wall, he still has not told the American people how or when that could possibly happen.

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Representative McCaul's. President Trump’s border wall is going to cost American taxpayers $25 billion or more. I oppose it and urge you to reject any motion to move forward with it.
