The American Health Care Act (AHCA) attempts to make good on the longtime conservative objective of defunding Planned Parenthood: it includes a provision that would deny federal funding in the form of Medicaid to any healthcare provider who performs abortion services. This is a despicable attack on women’s health, particularly poor women’s health. Planned Parenthood provides basic healthcare services to 2.5 million women a year, about 75% of whom have incomes that are at or below 150% of the federal poverty level. A majority of Americans do not want to see it defunded. And yet, Republicans like Paul Ryan are determined to punish the organization for performing abortions, even though they account for just 3% of all services provided, and have not been eligible for federal funding since 1976. Apparently it is more important to make a point than it is to protect the health of millions of women.

**CALL Congressman McCaul to tell him to vote no on the AHCA, and any bill that defunds Planned Parenthood.**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Representative McCaul. I am calling to express how troubled I am that the AHCA would defund Planned Parenthood. If this happened, 2.5 million women, many of them poor, would lose access to the many vital services Planned Parenthood provides them with each year, such as birth control and cancer screenings. [If you have a personal story about how Planned Parenthood has impacted your life, consider telling it.\\
\\
We must keep politics out of women’s health. I’m urging Rep. McCaul to vote no on the AHCA, and any bill that defunds Planned Parenthood.
