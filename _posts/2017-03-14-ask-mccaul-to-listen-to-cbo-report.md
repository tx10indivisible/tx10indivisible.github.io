In his "tele-town hall" last week, Rep. McCaul specifically said that he would take the upcoming CBO report into consideration... now it's out, so let's follow up with him!

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released it's projections for the American Health Care Act (AHCA) on Monday.

Some of the highlights of their assessment include the following:

* Would result in approximately 24 million Americans losing their health insurance while raising premiums for those covered on the individual market.

* Would lower federal deficits by $337 billion over 10 years, but largely because of cuts in Medicaid--which would be cut by $880 billion

* Increase average premiums by 15-20 percent in 2018 and 2019.

* Would reduce revenues by $592 billion over the period 2017-2026 by giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people and companies in the country.

**CALL Congressman McCAUL to express your concern (outrage!) about the effect of the AHCA on the health of the people of this country.**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is ______________ and I am a constituent of Representative McCaul. I am calling to express my concern (outrage!) about AHCA in light of what the Congressional Budget Office determined in their scoring process. I would like to know whether Rep. McCaul has taken this scoring into consideration as he said he would last week. If this bill passes, millions of Americans will be without affordable coverage, lives will be lost, and families across the country will be forced to with decide between their health and financial stability.
