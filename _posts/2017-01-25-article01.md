Calling all TX-10 activists! We're holding a welcoming and organizing meeting this Sunday Jan 29th at 11:30am. We'll discuss TX-10 Indivisible strategies, sign up volunteers, and break out to groups to decide work assignments.

If you reside in District 10 (Rep. Michael McCaul) and want to get more involved in the Indivisible movement. Please join us. We need YOU!

The facility has off-street parking and is easily accessed via Cap Metro. (Warning: the Waze app has been known to misdirect people at this location. Use something else.)
