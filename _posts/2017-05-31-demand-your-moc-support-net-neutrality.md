Our Senators have co-sponsored a bill making it impossible for the FCC to ever reinstate net neutrality, should they proceed with revoking it. This bill only benefits billion dollar communication companies--not their constituents or democracy!

**CALL Senators Cruz and Cornyn and tell them you oppose their efforts to dismantle net neutrality!**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT:
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Senator [CRUZ or CORNYN]. I am asking him to WITHDRAW his SPONSORSHIP from the Restoring Internet Freedom Act. Net neutrality is vital to ensuring the free flow of communication and information. Without this protection, ISPs would be free to slow or block content based on payments from content providers or even the viewpoint expressed. The Senator needs to put his constituents above his campaign donors.
