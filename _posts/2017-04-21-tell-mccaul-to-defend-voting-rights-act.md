Texas Republicans have been handed yet another federal court ruling that says their voting laws have violated the Constitution by intentionally disenfranchising minorities. Many of these minorities are constituents of Rep. McCaul and we deserve to know his stance on these rulings. It would be great if he had the courage to defend his constituents and the Constitution by speaking publicly in favor of changes to Texas' voter laws to make them fair and nondiscriminatory, but at the very least, we need to let him know we'll be watching him closely on this issue!

**CALL Congressman McCAUL and AND ASK HIM TO DEFEND THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT**


## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I'm a constituent of Rep. McCaul. I would like to know what his stance is on the recent federal court rulings calling Texas' voter laws unconstitutional and discriminatory...*THEY WILL PROBABLY SAY HE HAS NO PUBLIC STANCE* ... Many of his constituents have been disenfranchised by these laws. I urge him to speak publicly about the need for Texas lawmakers to amend their voting laws to be nondiscriminatory. I would hope his respect for Constitutional Rights is above partisanship.
