On Wednesday, in a ruling that applies nationally, a United States District Judge for the District of Hawaii issued an injunction against the Trump administration in its efforts to impose the latest travel ban Executive Order. As reported in The Washington Post, “In finding the ban violated the establishment clause, the court found ‘significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus.’”

In Maryland, another federal District Judge also issued an order stopping the travel ban from going forward.

At a rally last night, Trump himself admitted that the revised order was simply a “watered-down version” of the first Executive Order.

Representative McCaul has stated,

>I have offered advice to President Trump on how to develop better, common-sense security checks for immigrants and refugees, and as the administration weighs next steps, I will press for responsible screening policies that keep Americans safe while upholding our values.

**CALL Congressman McCaul and ask him to PUBLICLY COMMENT on the revised travel ban.**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;, and I am a constituent of Representative McCaul. I am calling to let the Representative know how distressed I am by the revised travel ban Executive Order. Mr. Trump himself stated that it was simply a “watered-down version” of the original order. Even this revision has been blocked by 2 United States district judges. Representative McCaul has stated that he offered advice to the President on how to develop better security checks. Did the President follow his advice? If not, then I would urge Representative McCaul to publicly comment on the flawed revision.
