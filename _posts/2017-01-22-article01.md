Yesterday was **amazing** but the fight has just begun. Are you ready
for more action?

Join Indivisible, MoveOn.org, and Working Families Party leaders for a
live call and training this Sunday on how to take immediate and effective
action to block the Trump/Republican agenda, starting with rallies at
our senators' district offices this Tuesday to stop Trump's Cabinet.

Sign up to agree to receive a telephone call from MoveOn.org at the
telephone number provided, to participate in the call tonight Sunday,
January 22 at 7 PM local time.

**This** is what democracy looks like.
