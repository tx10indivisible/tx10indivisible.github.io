Call and demand that Congressman McCaul and Senators Cornyn and Cruz compel the testimony of Sally Yates in an open hearing before a congressional Intelligence Committee.

Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates was scheduled to testify Tuesday in an OPEN HEARING before the House Intelligence Committee in its investigation of Russian interference in the presidential election and any possible ties between Trump’s campaign and Russian officials. Whether or not the White House continues to argue executive privilege or attorney-client privilege (arguments that Yates and her attorney dispute, and Sean Spicer claims the President never pressed), the House Intelligence Committee cancelled the hearing, making the discussion of privilege a moot point. Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee has begun its own investigation into Russian interference, and the Committee’s ranking member stated “that he would ‘like to see Ms. Yates at some point’ before his Committee.”
