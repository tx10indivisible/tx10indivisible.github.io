As far as the Paris climate accord and protecting the environment go, it’s Trump and the fossil fuel industry vs. everyone else. Even China and India have accelerated their investments in cost-effective renewable energy sources and reduced their reliance on fossil fuels.

On Sunday, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham rebuked 22 of his GOP colleagues, including Senators Cruz and Cornyn, for their letter urging Trump to withdraw from Paris. “Withdrawal from the agreement,” he said, "would be taken as a statement that climate change is not a problem, is not real."

To side with Trump and the fossil fuel billionaires over the overwhelming majority of Americans who support the accord is a crime against the future of people and the planet. The U.S. under this Administration is ceding a leadership role in an increasingly important global arena.

**Call Senators Cruz and Cornyn and tell them it’s time for the U.S. to join the 21st century and the rest of the modern world to stop climate change. There are no jobs on a dead planet.**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT:
>Hi, I’m a constituent of Senator [Cruz/ Cornyn]. My name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I live in &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;. I urge Sen. [Cruz/Cornyn] to support the Paris climate accord and to work to stop climate change. Anything else is reckless. Ultimately, such shortsightedness will give China the edge in new sciences for renewable energy and the role as the leader of the world.
