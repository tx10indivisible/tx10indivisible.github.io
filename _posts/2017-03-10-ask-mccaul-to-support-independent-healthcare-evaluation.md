After the release of the AHCA earlier this week, many are waiting to hear the scoring of the bill by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). However, Republicans are moving to involve Mick Mulvaney, head of the Office of Management and Budget, in scoring. What this means is that scoring would be done by an office directly under Trump instead of an independent, non-partisan entity like the CBO. Obviously, Republicans are fearful that the CBO will expose the AHCA's negative impact on the national budget and health coverage for millions of Americans.

**CALL Congressman McCaul to express your concern about eliminating the role of the Congressional Budget Office in the scoring process for the AHCA**. Americans deserve to have a fair and accurate account of the impact of such a bill on the health and well-being (both physical and financial) of the country.

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
> Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Representative McCaul. I am calling to express my concern about the scoring of the AHCA by the Office of Management and Budget. The Congressional Budget Office has an important role in ensuring that a fair and accurate score is shared with the American people. I can't imagine that Rep. McCaul would want to vote on this bill without knowing its true impact on the national budget and the lives of his constituents.
