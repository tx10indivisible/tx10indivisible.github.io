Today is a BIG DAY! If the AHCA fails to pass the House, it's a HUGE loss for Trump and a win for constituent power. Call and tell Representative McCaul to vote against Trumpcare!

A house vote on the AHCA is scheduled for **TODAY**!

**CALL Representative McCAUL and tell him that the AHCA is a disaster for the 61,800 people in his district who according to the Congressional Budget Office will lose their health insurance if this bill passes. Urge him to VOTE NO.**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
