Scientists agree that the Earth is getting warmer, and pollution is causing serious health risks to all of us. Our own Representative McCaul, however, has cosponsored H.R. 637, a resolution that allows polluters to poison our air and water. H.R. 637 places profits over clean air and our future.

Today students, future scientists, and future earth-dwellers, will meet at Representative McCaul’s office to let him know that they oppose H.R. 637, they’re scared about climate change, and they want good science taught in schools!

If you cannot make it to the in-person action, call McCaul’s office and let him know that we need to take the environment and global climate change seriously for the sake of our children and grandchildren.
