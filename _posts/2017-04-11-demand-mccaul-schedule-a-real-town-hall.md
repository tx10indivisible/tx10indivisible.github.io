TX-10 Indivisible is going to Congressman McCaul's office TUESDAY, APRIL 11th @ NOON to hold our own town hall. Let’s make sure his recess starts with a big “WE’RE STILL HERE!” If you cannot attend, support our in-person town hall action by echoing and amplifying the message with your phone calls.

**CALL Representative McCAUL and CALL NOW and DEMAND CONGRESSMAN McCAUL SCHEDULE A REAL TOWN HALL!**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Congressman McCaul's. He declined to attend a town hall during his last recess, claiming scheduling difficulty. It has now been months since he's been aware of the great demand in his district to engage directly with the people he represents. I urge him to show his respect for his constituents by engaging with them in an in-person town hall.
