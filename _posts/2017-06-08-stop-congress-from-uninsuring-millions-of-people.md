The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis of the revised American Health Care Act (AHCA) is in, and its findings are clear: the bill will strip 14 million Americans of health insurance by next year and 23 million by 2026 while making coverage unaffordable for millions more. In fact, the AHCA would leave more Americans uninsured by 2026 than were uninsured prior to the ACA's passage in 2010.

The AHCA's rollback of Medicaid expansion alone would immediately deprive 11 million low-income people of insurance access. The AHCA's changes to the individual insurance market, where roughly 19 million Americans buy insurance (via federal and state marketplace plans and other nongroup plans), would also reduce insurance coverage. By replacing income-based tax credits with age-based credits, the bill would drive up nongroup premiums dramatically for low-income, older enrollees. For some older adults, their premiums could go up by as much as 800%. However, wealthy Americans would receive tax breaks totaling roughly $900 billion thanks to the new tax credit structure.

An estimated 1 in 6 people live in states that would request AHCA regulatory waivers, which would allow insurers to reinstate price discrimination based on health status and end coverage of essential health benefits. The CBO estimates that many sicker people would be priced out of the insurance market altogether. For many more consumers, out-of-pocket spending on maternity care, mental health and substance abuse services could increase by thousands of dollars in a given year.

The CBO estimated the AHCA could reduce premiums overall, but it would achieve this by making insurance unattainable for older and sicker Americans and by allowing insurers to offer much skimpier plans. We must not allow the Senate to reverse years of progress in increasing healthcare access.

## SAMPLE SCRIPT:
> Hi, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I'm a constituent calling from [Austin / your city].
I'm calling today because I'm opposed to the American Health Care Act, which would leave even more Americans uninsured than pre-ACA and drive up premiums for millions more.
[Optional: Share a personal story about how this bill will impact you or someone you know]
I urge [SEN NAME] to vote against the AHCA and ensure the ACA's expansion of Medicaid and protections for people with preexisting conditions remain in place.
Thank you for your time.

Consider adding one of these questions
1. As your constituent, can you promise me that you:
- "…won't vote for a bill that would lead to millions of Americans losing their health coverage?"
- "…won't vote for a bill without first knowing its full implications from a CBO score?"
2. Can you guarantee that any replacement plan will cover at least as many people as would be covered under the ACA? Can you guarantee that no one will lose their coverage as a result of your vote?
3. I [or someone I know] has "x" condition and I'm afraid that I [they] will be unable to obtain affordable health coverage because of my [their] pre-existing condition. I want to know if you can assure me that I'll be able to get the same consumer protections as the ACA, including for a pre-existing condition?
4. Can you assure me that funding for Medicaid won't get cut under ANY replacement plan?
5. Can you also assure me that Medicaid will remain an entitlement, and that anyone eligible will be guaranteed coverage?
