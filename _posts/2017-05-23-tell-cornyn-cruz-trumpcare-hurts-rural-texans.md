Obamacare made advances in providing health care access to rural Americans, and rural residents were more likely to gain coverage under the ACA. Unfortunately, Trumpcare will reverse those gains. Eliminating need-based tax credits for the purchase of health insurance will disproportionately impact rural Americans. Fewer insured individuals will result in closure of rural hospitals. The CBO had predicted 24 million will lose health care under Trumpcare, including many farmers and ranchers. The tax credits based on income created by the ACA gave farmers and ranchers greater access to insurance, since they are more likely to obtain insurance in the individual markets The GOP proposed lower compensation rates for Medicare and Medicaid increases the uncompensated care at rural hospitals. In rural areas of Texas, 20 percent currently have Medicaid coverage. Slashing Medicaid, as proposed by the GOP health plan, will devastate rural America, the very people who believed voting for Trump and GOP candidates would improve their lives. They will soon find out that they have been scammed.

Join the Die-in at Cornyn's office today at noon, or call to tell our Senators that the ACA is dead on arrival.

## SAMPLE SCRIPT:
>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Senator Cruz/Cornyn. Since 20% of rural Texans depend on Medicaid, the GOP health care plan will devastate rural Texas hospitals and clinics and put the lives of rural Texans at risk. Will Senator C/C turn his back on his most loyal supporters and allow this cruel transfer of wealth from lower income Texans to our nationâ€™s wealthiest take place?
