Republicans in the House including Michael McCaul sided with Trump over the wellbeing of their constituents when they voted to pass TrumpCare. They voted for it without a CBO score, meaning that they didn’t even know the harm it would do to the American people. We now have a CBO score and it is every bit as bad as we dreaded it would be.

**Call senators Cornyn and Cruz and ask them 5 important questions about the replacement for the ACA.**

## SAMPLE SCRIPT:
We have recently learned some troubling truths about Trumpcare from a CBO report; among them, 23 million people would lose health insurance if it becomes law. Because of this, I have some questions for Senator [Cruz, Cornyn]:
1. Will he pledge not to vote for a bill that would lead to millions of Americans losing their health coverage?
2. Will he promise his constituents not to vote for a bill without first learning its full implications from a CBO score?
3. Will he guarantee that any replacement plan he supports will cover AT LEAST as many people that would be covered under the ACA?
4. Will he assure me that I’ll be able to get the same consumer protections as the ACA, including for a pre-existing condition?
5. Will he ensure that funding for Medicaid won’t get cut under any replacement plan?
