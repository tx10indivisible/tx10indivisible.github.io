As with so many other issues, Rep. McCaul has stayed relatively quiet and invisible on Trump's decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord (other than a single facebook post), even as many other Texas officials and businesses have weighed in on both sides of the issue. (Cornyn and Cruz may be totally wrongheaded, but at least they have the courage to state their positions publicly.) This is too large an issue for him to skate by under the radar. Call McCaul's office today and ask about his position on the Paris Accord. Ask how he thinks it will impact Texans living on the coast. Ask if he's considered the rising cost of home insurance for Texans as floods and severe storms become more common. Ask if he's thought about the thousands of Texans who work in the energy sector who will be at a disadvantage against foreign workers and companies that are embracing green technologies. Ask how our refusal to work with other nations on global problems will lessen their willingness to work with us on issues of national security. Finally, ask if he cares about the future he is leaving is own children and grandchildren. Let's tie up the phone lines and share the responses you get in the comments below!
