Michael McCaul voted to strip away healthcare from millions of Americans and replace it with a plan that would be disastrous for our country. Please join us at 2:30 in a protest at McCaul's office. If you cannot join in person, please amplify the message by calling and telling Michael McCaul that letting people die because they can't afford health insurance is immoral and unacceptable.

## SAMPLE SCRIPT

>Hello, my name is &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; and I am a constituent of Representative McCaul’s. It is immoral to let people die because they cannot afford health insurance. If the AHCA bill that he voted for becomes law, millions of people who have insurance now will loose it. Access to affordable care is needed to keep people from dying when treatment could otherwise save their lives, and the AHCA decreases access to affordable care instead of increasing it. (Tell a personal story about someone you know who could die if they lost access to health insurance/healthcare.
